**Working of java program:

Ex: Hello.java ----> byte code(.class) --> JMM (run program).

JVM, JRE, and JDK:
1. JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
   - It is an abstract machine that provides a runtime environment to execute Java bytecode.
   - It converts bytecode into machine-specific code.
   - It is platform-dependent, meaning there are different JVMs for different operating systems.
2. JRE (Java Runtime Environment):
    - It is a package that provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components to run 
        applications written in Java.
    - It does not include development tools like compilers or debuggers.
    - It is used by end-users to run Java applications.
3. JDK (Java Development Kit):
    - It is a complete package that includes JRE along with development tools like compilers (javac), 
        debuggers, and other utilities needed for Java development.
    - It is used by developers to write, compile, and debug Java applications.
    - It contains everything that JRE has, plus additional tools for development.
In summary:
- JVM is the engine that runs Java bytecode.
- JRE is the environment that provides the necessary libraries and JVM to run Java applications.
- JDK is the complete toolkit for Java development, including JRE and development tools.

** Java Keywords:
Java keywords are reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the Java programming language.
They cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names, class names, or method names) in a Java program.
Here are some commonly used Java keywords:  
1. abstract
2. assert
3. boolean
4. break
5. byte
6. case
7. catch
8. char
9. class
10. const
11. continue
12. default
13. do
14. double
15. else
16. enum
17. extends
18. final
19. finally
20. float
21. for
22. if
23. goto
24. implements
25. import
26. instanceof
27. int
28. interface
29. long..

** Java Variables:
In Java, a variable is a container that holds data values during the execution of a program.
There are three main types of variables in Java:
1. Local Variables:
   - Declared within a method, constructor, or block.
   - Accessible only within the scope they are defined.
   - Must be initialized before use.
2. Instance Variables:
    - Declared within a class but outside
        any method, constructor, or block.
    - Accessible by all methods in the class.
    - Each instance (object) of the class has its own copy of instance variables.
3. Static Variables (Class Variables):
    - Declared with the static keyword within a class but outside
        any method, constructor, or block.
    - Shared among all instances of the class.
    - Accessible using the class name or through instances.
Example:
```java
public class Example {
    // Instance variable
    int instanceVar;

    // Static variable
    static int staticVar;

    public void method() {
        // Local variable
        int localVar = 10;
        System.out.println("Local Variable: " + localVar);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj1 = new Example();
        Example obj2 = new Example();

        obj1.instanceVar = 5;
        obj2.instanceVar = 10;

        Example.staticVar = 15;

        System.out.println("Instance Variable of obj1: " + obj1.instanceVar);
        System.out.println("Instance Variable of obj2: " + obj2.instanceVar);
        System.out.println("Static Variable: " + Example.staticVar);

        obj1.method();
    }
}
```
In this example:
- `instanceVar` is an instance variable, each object (`obj1` and `obj2`) has its own copy.
- `staticVar` is a static variable, shared among all instances of the class.
- `localVar` is a local variable, accessible only within the `method()`.

** 8 Types of Data Types:
Java has two main categories of data types: primitive data types and reference data types. Here, we will focus on the 8 primitive data types in Java:
1. byte:
   - Size: 8 bits
   - Range: -128 to 127
   - Description: Used to save memory in large arrays.
2. short:
    - Size: 16 bits
    - Range: -32,768 to 32,767
    - Description: Also used to save memory in large arrays.
3. int:
    - Size: 32 bits
    - Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
    - Description: Default data type for integer values.
4. long:
    - Size: 64 bits
    - Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
    - Description: Used for larger integer values.
5. float:
    - Size: 32 bits
    - Range: Approximately ±3.40282347E+38F (6-7 significant decimal digits)
    - Description: Used for single-precision floating-point values.
6. double:
     - Size: 64 bits
     - Range: Approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308 (15 significant decimal digits)
     - Description: Used for double-precision floating-point values.
7. char:
    - Size: 16 bits
    - Range: '\u0000' (0) to '\uffff' (65,535)
    - Description: Used to store a single 16-bit Unicode character.
8. boolean:
    - Size: Not precisely defined (depends on the JVM implementation)
    - Values: true or false
    - Description: Used for simple flags that track true/false conditions.
These primitive data types are the building blocks for data manipulation in Java programs.

** Java Operators:
Java operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on variables and values.
Here are the main categories of Java operators:
1. Arithmetic Operators:
   - Used for basic mathematical operations.
   - Examples: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus)
2. Relational Operators:
    - Used to compare two values.
    - Examples: == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to)
3. Logical Operators:
    - Used to combine multiple boolean expressions.
    - Examples: && (logical AND), || (logical OR), ! (logical NOT)
4. Assignment Operators:
    - Used to assign values to variables.
    - Examples: = (simple assignment), += (add and assign), -= (subtract and assign), *= (multiply and assign), /= (divide and assign), %= (modulus and assign)
5. Unary Operators:
    - Used with a single operand to perform various operations.
    - Examples: ++ (increment), -- (decrement), + (unary plus), - (unary minus)
6. Bitwise Operators:
    - Used to perform bit-level operations.
    - Examples: & (bitwise AND), | (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwise XOR), ~ (bitwise NOT), << (left shift), >> (right shift), >>> (unsigned right shift)
7. Ternary Operator:
    - A shorthand for an if-else statement.
    - Syntax: condition ? expression1 : expression2
    - Example: int result = (a > b) ? a : b; // assigns the greater value to result
8. instanceof Operator:
    - Used to test whether an object is an instance of a specific class or implements a specific interface.
    - Example: if (obj instanceof String) { // do something }
These operators are essential for performing various operations in Java programming.

* Binary Addition Operator:
The binary addition operator in Java is the plus sign (+). It is used to add two numeric values together.
The operator takes two operands and returns their sum.
Example:
```java
public class BinaryAdditionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5;
        int b = 10;
        int sum = a + b; // Using the binary addition operator
        System.out.println("The sum of " + a + " and " + b + " is: " + sum);
    }
}

** Types of Operators in Java:
1. Arithmetic Operators
    - Examples: +, -, *, /, %
2. Relational Operators
    - Examples: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
3. Logical Operators
    - Examples: &&, ||, !
4. Assignment Operators
    - Examples: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
5. Unary Operators
    - Examples: ++, --, +, -
6. Bitwise Operators
    - Examples: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>
7. Ternary Operator
    - Example: condition ? expression1 : expression2
8. instanceof Operator
    - Example: obj instanceof ClassName
These operators are used to perform various operations in Java programming.

```
** Java Control Statements:
Java control statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They allow you to make decisions, repeat actions, and branch the execution based on certain conditions.
Here are the main types of control statements in Java:
1. Conditional Statements:
   - if statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
   - if-else statement: Executes one block of code if a condition is true and another block if it is false.
   - switch statement: Allows multi-way branching based on the value of a variable.
